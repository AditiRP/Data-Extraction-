# Structured_data_extraction
The project focuses on developing a sophisticated system designed to extract relevant information from a diverse array of unstructured data sources. These sources include documents, emails, and articles, which often contain valuable information buried within text that lacks a consistent format or structure.

The system will employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze and interpret the text within these unstructured data sources. It enables the system to understand the context, identify key information, and extract data that is most pertinent to the user's needs. This process may involve various tasks such as entity recognition, sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and summarization.
